## MiniSat

- "minimalistic, open-source SAT solver" 
- "Easy to modify" 
- "Highly efficient" 
- "Designed for integration"

- a CDCL Solver (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) using 2-watching scheme

## 2-Watching Scheme

- each clause is watched by two non-falsified literals
- if one watching literal is falsified during propagation, another must be found, otherwise it leads to unit propagation or conflict analysis

## CDCL Loop

(flowchart)
- search -> propagate
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | decide
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## Incremental SAT Solving

- support adding clauses during solving
- used within SMT solvers or within the SAT modulo Symmetries framework

## IPASIR-UP Interface (User Propagators for CDCL)

- notify:
  - assignments
  - decision level
  - backtrack
- request if there is:
  - next decision literal
  - external clause
  - external propagation (with lazy clause)

was only implemented in CaDiCaL

now with MiniSat as my Masterproject

## Solving Time Adding Clause

- clause that is tautology or root-satisfied is ignored
- root-falsified literals are removed
- empty clause leads to unsat
- unit clause leads to propagation
- clause with two or more literals left is watched

### 2-Watching Scheme: Observation

in decision level l > 0:
- if a new literal is propagated: the propagating clause (reason clause of the literal) is watched by this literal (assigned true) and another literal assigned false both of level l, all other literals are false with level <= l
- if a conflict clause is discovered: the clause is watched by two literals both of level l, all other literals are false with level <= l

after backtracking to level k < l:
- the propagating clause or conflict clause at level l is still watched by the same two literals, now both unassigned

### Watching

- sort literals by assignment(true/false/unassigned) and decision level: True(low - high) - Unassigned - False(high - low)
- watch the first two literals after sorting

### Cases

The first two literals after sorting (respectively of level l1, l2 if assigned)
- unassigned, unassigned (skip)
- unassigned, false:
  - backtrack to level l2
  - propagate
- false, false:
  - l1 > l2:
    - backtrack to level l2
    - propagate
  - l1 = l2:
    - backtrack to level l1 = l2
    - raise current clause as conflict, trigger conflict analysis
- true, unassigned (skip)
- true, false:
  - l1 > l2:
    - backtrack to level l2
    - propagate
  - l1 <= l2 (skip)
- true, true (skip)

## Updated CDCL Loop

(flowchart)
- search -> propagate 
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | *interact*
- *interact -> add | decide*
- *add -> unsat | propagate | analyze | interact*
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## External Propagation

(flowchart)
- search -> propagate
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | interact
- interact -> *propagate* | add | decide
- add -> unsat | propagate | analyze | interact
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## Adding Lazy Clause For a Propagated Literal

during conflict analysis

- similar to solving time adding clause
- under current implementation, it can't be a root level unit

## Fuzzing (Lab)

to be able to test the implementation and ensure the correctness

- implementing the ExternalPropagator interface
- simulating the interaction between MiniSat and ExternalPropagator
- check model

Fuzzing procedure:
- generate random CNF as input (with cnfuzz)
- split clauses for Solver and Propagator
- print proof in DRUP format
- check proof (with drup checker)

### Fuzzing Result

- a bug with the sorting predicate found and fixed early
- a bug found related with lazy propagations when the reason clause of a propagated literal is marked with a placeholder
