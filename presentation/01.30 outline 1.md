# Implementing IPASIR-UP Interface on MiniSat

2025/02/05

## MiniSat

- CDCL
- 2-watching scheme

## CDCL Loop

- search -> propagate
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | decide
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## 2-Watching Scheme

- each clause is watched by two non-falsified literals
- if one watching literal is falsified during propagation, another must be found, otherwise it leads to unit propagation or conflict analysis

## Incremental SAT Solving

- support adding clauses during solving
- used within SMT solvers or within the SAT modulo Symmetries framework 

## IPASIR-UP (User Propagators for CDCL) Interface

- notify:
  - assignments
  - decision level
  - backtrack
- ask for:
  - next decision literal
  - external clause
  - external propagations (with lazy clause)

was only implemented in CaDiCaL
now with MiniSat as my Masterproject

Fazekas et al. IPASIR-UP: User Propagators for CDCL

## Updated CDCL Loop

- search -> propagate
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | *interact*
- *interact -> add | decide*
- *add -> unsat | propagate | analyze | interact*
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## Solving Time Adding Clause

- clause that is tautology or root-satisfied is ignored
- root-falsified literals are removed
- empty clause leads to unsat
- unit clause leads to propagation
- clauses with two or more literals left?

### 2-Watching Scheme: Observation

(suppose it's always the first 2 literals watching a clause)

in decision level l:
- if a new literal is propagated: the propagating clause (reason clause of the literal) is watched by this literal (assigned true) and another literal assigned false both of level l, all other literals are false with level <= l
- if a conflict clause is discovered: the clause is watched by two literals both of level l, all other literals are falst with level <= l

after backtracking to level k < l:
- the propagating clause or conflict clause at level l is still watched by the same two literals, now both unassigned

### Sorting Literals

adding a new clause with two or more literals in decision level l:
- sort literals by assignment(true/false/unassigned) and decision level: True(low - high) - Unassigned - False(high - low)
- watch the first two literals after sorting (each of level l1, l2 if assigend)

### Trigger Propagate or Conflict

adding a new clause with two or more literals in decision level l:
- cases by the first two literals and their levels:
  - unassigned, unassigned (skip)
  - unassigned, false:
    - backtrack to level l2
    - propagate
  - false, false:
    - l1 > l2:
      - backtrack to level l2
      - propagate
    - l1 = l2:
      - backtrack to level l1 = l2
      - mark the current clause as conflict, trigger conflict analysis
  - true, unassigned
  - true, false:
    - l1 > l2:
      - backtrack to level l2
      - propagate
    - l1 <= l2
  - true, true

## External Propagation

- search -> propagate
- propagate -> analyze | simplify
- analyze -> unsat | propagate
- simplify -> unsat | interact
- interact -> *propagate* | add | decide
- add -> unsat | propagate | analyze | interact
- decide -> sat | propagate
- unsat
- sat

## Lazy Explaination For a Propagated Literal

- similar to solving time adding clause, but the added clause should only contain this one true literal
- can't be true in root level yet (to be implemented)

## Fuzzing (Lab)

- to 

- implementing the ExternalPropagator interface
- simulating the interaction between MiniSat and ExternalPropagator

Fuzzing procedure:
- generate random CNF as input (using cnfuzz)
- split clauses for Solver and Propagator
- print proof in DRUP format while solving
- check proof (with drup checker)

### Fuzzing Result

- a bug found related with lazy propagations when the reason clause of a literal is only a placeholder
