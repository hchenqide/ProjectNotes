It looks good, I suggest to slightly reorder by:

1. Moving the incremental SAT solving at the beginning to motivate the
talk (I added some text, but what you say is left to you)

    ## Incremental SAT Solving
     - SAT solvers work great,
     - sometimes you wont to refine a solution / cannot translate
      everything: incremental usage
     - But sometimes you want even more control on the solver
       + SAT solver does what it does best: propagating and inprocessing
       + for all rest, first ask user
      - used within SMT solvers or within the SAT modulo Symmetries framework

    [I would put here the IPASIR flowchart first, then the CDCL one, then IPASIR-UP flowchart]


2. Add as a second slide on what you did:

    ## Solution

    - Fazekas et al. IPASIR-UP: User Propagators for CDCL only implemented in
    CaDiCal

    - This work: implementing all that in MiniSAT and fuzzing it for correctness


[At this point everyone knows why you are doing it and why you are doing
it]


3. I think I would put the order CDCL -> MiniSAT -> IPASIR-UP instead of
your current ordering, but this is taste


4. Motivate the "lazy" by most propagation are useless [80% in one
paper] and can reasons can be expensive to calculate.


5. I think that I would move to watching to the end before fuzzing
because it is "scientific peak" and basically you will loose every one
who is not Florian, Armin, or me.

It is also the first thing, I would shorten if need be by removing the
"observation" slide and just stating that the ordering is important for
the implementation.

To shorten it even more, you could just say:

    ## Repair Flowchart

    We detect that if had known the new clause earlier:
      - it would have been a conflict in the flowchart, so we backtrack to
      it and mark it as conflict
      - it would have been a propagation in the flowchart, so we backtrack to
      it and mark it as propagation
      - it would not have changed the execution, so we fix invariants and
      add it

    Remark: CaDiCaL does out-of-order propagation by more flexible on the
    flowchart

I leave it to you how much you decide to shorten the slide. If you find
the shortest version too short, you could show that C++ piece of code
and briefly comment it.
