cvc5
Isabelle/HOL
verified SeL4 Microkernel

SMT solver. automatic proof
FOL expressive logic
Amazon's Zelkova Tool

check the solver
check the answer, make the answer checkable 

reconstructing cvc5 proofs in Isabelle 

sledgehammer gets some information from external provers to reconstruct the proof, filter out the core lemmas

translate to smt problem, send to cvc5 solver

sat: give an assignment 
unsat: 
proof certificate to be checked
checking granularity
transform steps with logic rules
apply rewrite rules to directly simplify formula
those rules are stored in rare database, and translated into lemmas in Isabelle 

bit vector checking
